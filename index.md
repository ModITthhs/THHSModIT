## THHS ModIT
We in ModIT focus on Modern Innovative Technology! We hope to guide others in code, CAD, and data analysis and inspire them to use these skills in their future.

### Code
We like to focus on Java and Python in ModIT, and do fun and creative projects with those languages. We help guide you in learning the languages, and once you have an understanding, we help you put those skills to use by writing useful programs for everyday.

### CAD
CAD stands for Computer Aided Design. We use OnShape to design objects in 3D models and have fun doing it. Its like drawing in 3D!

### Data Analysis
We use a program called R to help organize and analyze data! Its a useful program to know how to navigate for future jobs, especially in science research or for corporate data analysis. We can teach you to create graphs and interpret results using the R program.
